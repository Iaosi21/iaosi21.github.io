    <h1>How to unlock the oneui 8 bootloader</h1>
    <h2>Requirements: a FIB (Focused Ion Beam) machine, a extreme microscope</h2>
	<p>Please note that these are specialized lab equipment and very expensive (around 1 million dollars. maybe less on ebay). I recommend you buy used machines.</p>
	<h3>Step 1: </h3>
		<p>locate the fuses on the die using the microscope. you would see a little fuse bank (this is very hard to do)</p>
	<h3>Step 2: Using the FIB </h3>
		<p>Mill away the metal layer, Apply ion beam to blow or cut a fuse (Warning: this would need a exact schematic, hard to get also one mistake could destroy nearby circuits) also I'm not sure which efuse is for the bootloader.</p>
	<h3>Step 3: Verification</h3> 
	      <p>Reassemble the device and boot it up. if it booted up then it's a good sign.</p>
